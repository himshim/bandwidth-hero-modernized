A modernized version of the [Bandwidth Hero](https://github.com/ayastreb/bandwidth-hero) extension for Manifest V3, originally created by **[ayastreb](https://github.com/ayastreb)**.

## üåü About This Project

Bandwidth Hero helps you save data by compressing images on web pages through a proxy server. This version has been completely modernized to work with Chrome's latest Manifest V3 requirements.

> **This is my personal hobby project.**  
> I've updated it to keep it functional in modern browsers, but to keep this extension alive and improving, **I need your help!**

This project is part of my personal journey to modernize the Bandwidth Hero ecosystem. I previously created [bandwidth-hero-proxy2](https://github.com/himshim/bandwidth-hero-proxy2) as a hobby project to update the proxy functionality, and now I'm continuing that work with this extension modernization.
